Integrates Meta Box's custom fields with Elementor page builder via dynamic tags.

== Description ==

Easily select and show custom fields created by the [Meta Box](https://metabox.io) plugin in the [Elementor](https://elementor.com) page builder via dynamic tags (available in the Pro version).

The plugin works for all field types. And you don't have to remember the field name or field ID to type. You just need to select it from the dropdown list.
